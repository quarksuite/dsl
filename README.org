* Summary

This repo contains the prototype of a domain-specific language for QuarkSuite Core v2. Its intention is to act as a
translation/transmission layer for Core v2 functionality using web components. Both are works in progress built in
tandem with each other to ensure that they speak the same data language.

If you want to follow the progress of Core v2, [[https://github.com/quarksuite/core/blob/v2-workspace/Notebook.org][jump over to its repo]].

* Features

+ translates essential core functionality through a declarative workflow as web components
+ transmits its data for the core itself to use and send back
+ renders tokens for rapid development and live documentation
